    <h3>Spoilers alert</h3>
     <dt>Are Jon and Dany related?</dt>
     <dd class="invisible">Yes, Jon is actually Dany's nephew. Her older brother is his father.</dd>

    <dt>What's the significance of Jon's real name being Aegon Targeryen?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Aegon Targaryen was the name of the original conqueror of Westeros. He and his sisters rode in on their dragons and started the entire Targaryen dynasty. Long story short, itâ€™s kind of a big deal and Jon has some major shoes to fill.</dd>

    <dt>Between Jon and Daenerys, who has a better claim to the Iron Throne</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Technically, Jon does. You see, Rhaegar was the heir to the Iron Throne, which means his son is ahead of his siblings in the line of succession. Khaleesi is not gonna like this.</dd>
